## Description

This is a node program that uses inquirer to collect information about different employees in a job's hierarchy. It uses those inputs to generate a contact information webpage with all of the given employees information.

## Installation

Make sure you run npm init and npm i before you run the program, so you have all the necessary programs.

## Usage
Once packages are installed, you can use node to call the index.js file and the console will prompt you to enter multiple inputs. Once you input everything, the generator will generate a index.html file that has all the necessary code for your functioning webpage.

## Credits

I used similar CLI logic to a program written by another developer with the github username median-man.
